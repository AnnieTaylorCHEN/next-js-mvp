# This is a small project that uses Next.js.

- The app has albums, and album can display user name (number) and title of the album. 
- There is a filter where you can type name of the title to filter out albums that you want to see. 
- You can also filter by user id which are numbers here.
- You can combine both filters for specific result.
- When ablum is clicked, you will be link to the specific album's page to view the photos belonging to the album. 
- There is a display for photo information such as name and photo id. 
- Album name (id number) is displayed both in the title and browser tab, so people know which page they're at. 
- NOTE: Filter component and utils/helper function are imported and modified from my project [Petite & Minimal](https://www.petiteandminimal.com/) to save time. 

## Bonus 

Check out the "special" page which uses real photo API to display author and photo size. 

## Things to improve

- I didn't do extensive responsive design due to time limit 
- Obviously the style isn't ideal
- If designing and coding for a whole app, I would have used Atomic Design for component and more organized CSS
- Of course, for production, we would also set up environments, git hooks, and various lint and style configs
